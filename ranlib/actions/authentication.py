    # 1.) Use ranx CLI to start the ranx server on a specified host/port
    # 2.) After, send these credentials in a post request to the auth server. It will then open up a callback port and send the link (including the callback port) back. It will also update the dedicated cache with the info
    # 3.) With this link, print it to the terminal so the user can click and log in
    # 4.) In the meantime (while waiting for the user to log in), make a GET request to the ranx server that will just listen. This will stall the program just enough
    # 5.) Once the user is logged in, the auth server will make a request back to the ranx server, telling it that it's done. That will store the token and unblock the state so this function can finish
    # 6.) Close the ranx server via an api call to it (GET /kill)
    # 7.) Handle any errors that could've been encountered
    # 8.) "Yay! We are done and the user is logged in!" (Assuming everything is successful. Otherwise, deal with those)
